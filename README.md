## 🚀 Installation

Follow these steps to set up the OCR Web App locally:

### 1. **Install Prerequisites**
- **Python 3.12.6**: Download and install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Tesseract OCR**:
  - Windows: Download from [Tesseract’s GitHub](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) and add it to your system PATH (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`).
  - Verify installation: Run `tesseract --version` in your Command Prompt or terminal.

### 2. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OCR_WebApp.git
cd OCR_WebApp
```

### 3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
# or
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
```

### 4. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install flask pytesseract pillow
```

### 5. **Configure Tesseract Path**
If Tesseract is not in your system PATH, update the `app.py` file with the correct path:
```python
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'
```
